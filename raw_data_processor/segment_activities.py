"""
Functions for segmenting the sub-activities (e.g., walk_slow, stairs_up, etc.) from the sensor data using the y-axis of
the accelerometer.

Each acquisition was acquired using a pre-defined protocol that allows for easy task segmentation.
Walking recordings:
(1) walking on a plane surface (walking_slow, walking_medium, walking_fast)
(2) walking stairs (stairs_up, stairs_down)
--> synchronization jump at the beginning
--> between each sub-activity the subject stood still for 10 seconds

Standing recordings:
(1) standing while making coffee (cabinets_coffee) and moving/retrieving objects in cabinet (cabinets_folders)
(2) standing still (standing_still) and standing while conversion (standing_talk)
--> synchronization jump at the beginning
--> between each sub-activity the subject stood still for 5 seconds, jumped, and stood still for 5 seconds

Sitting recording:
sitting while working on a computer
--> synchronization jump at the beginning

synchronization jump at the beginning: after all sensors are connected
(1) stand still for ten seconds
(2) ten jumps
(3) stand still for ten seconds

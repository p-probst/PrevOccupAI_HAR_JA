    Generates a dataset in which all (sub)activities are segmented into their own respective files using the raw data
    files. Raw data was recorded in different recording sessions containing different sub-activities.
    (1) walking: walking slow - walking medium - walking fast (approx. 5 min each | 15 min total)
    (2) stairs: stairs up - stairs down - stairs up - stairs down (approx. 1:15 min | 5 min total)
            OR: stairs up - stairs down - stairs up - stairs down - stairs up - stairs down - stairs up - stairs down (approx. 0:38 min each | total 5 mmin)
    (3) cabinets: making coffee - organizing folder (approx. 7:30 min each | 15 min total)
    (4) standing: standing still - standing while conversion - standing still (approx. 3:45 min - 7.30 min - 3:45 min | 15 min total)
    (5) sitting: sitting while working on a computer (approx. 15 min)

    Thus, the function segments, for example, the sensor data for walking into walking_slow, walking_medium, and walking_fast.

    As the raw data is stored into individual files for each sensor type (e.g., ACC, GYR, MAG, ROTATION_VECTOR), the
    function also performs the following steps before segmenting the data:
    (1) aligns the individual sensors in time.
    (2) re-samples the data to the same sampling rate.
    (3) collects all sensors into the same data structure (pandas.DataFrame or numpy.array).
    :param raw_data_path: the path to the folder containing the raw data for each subject.
    :param segmented_data_path: the path to where the segmented data should be stored. The function generates a folder
                                named 'segmented_data' in which the data for each subject is stored.
    :param load_sensors: list of sensors (as strings) indicating which sensors should be loaded. Default: None (all sensors are loaded)
    :param fs: the sampling rate to which all sensors should be re-sampled to. Default: 100 (Hz)
    :param crop_n_seconds: the amount of seconds that should be cropped at the beginning and end of each segmented activity.
                           This is used to ensure that any transition between activities are removed. Default: 5 (seconds)
    :param plot_segment_lines: boolean that indicates whether a plot should be shown in which the obtained segmentation
                               indexes are plotted superimposed on the raw data signal. Default: False
    :param plot_cropped_tasks: boolean that indicates whether a plot should be shown in which each segmented activity
                               is plotted into a subplot. Default: False
    :param output_file_type: the file type that should be used to store the segmented files. Supported file types are:
                             '.npy' or '.csv'. Default: '.csv'
